# ss2qr
### read a QR code from clipboard using python
**Requires pyzbar and PIL (and python 3)**<br>
https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html <br>
https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/ <br>
## Usage:
- **If you want to use ss2qr without python, look into the releases section of this repo**
- Add the folder to which you downloaded the scripts into path
- Type `ss2qr <path>` in command line, path being an optional argument, if you want to read the code from a file
- Note that the script is very simple, thus use images/screenshots purely of the QR code
- It also requires you to have python in path, in case you have `python3` in path, edit it on the last line of `ss2qr.bat`
